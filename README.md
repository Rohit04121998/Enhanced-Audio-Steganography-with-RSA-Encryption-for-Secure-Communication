# Enhanced-Audio-Steganography-with-RSA-Encryption-for-Secure-Communication

Audio steganography is an efficient method to secure embedded data and sent it through internet. Unfortunately, the integrity of the message may be compromised with only the use of LSB method to hide data.  Hence, To provide secure communication by integrating Steganography on Audio Files along with an Encryption Algorithm such as RSA is proposed.

## Need for audio steganography

Rapid and sudden increase in the Transmission of digital data over the Internet forced researchers for enhancement in the security system. Steganography is the art of 'secret
writing'. It conceals the existence of a hidden message and allows it to be only extracted by intended recipient. Embedding secret data in digital audio cover is more challenging than using digital images as a cover since human visual system is less sensitive in comparison to human auditory system. Audio Steganography includes concealing information
in audio records. This technique conceals the information in WAV, AU and MP3 sound records. The advantage of steganography, over cryptography alone, is that messages do not attract attention to themselves. They have the potential capability of hiding the existence of confidential data thus eliminating any need for suspicion.

## Method

The proposed work aims to leverage the added benefits of steganography and en- cryption mechanisms to counter any drawbacks presented by these individual techniques. Implementation of data hiding using the LSB technique is presented in conjunction with the RSA encryption standard. A Graphical User Interface is also built to make the entire process user friendly and smooth.

The proposed algorithm was developed using Python and a GUI was built using the *tkinter* library provided by Python. Encoder and decoder modules were built. RSA was implemented along with the generation of prime numbers and secret keys. Lastly, the hiding and extraction of the text message in the audio file was shown with no change in the size of the file.

## RSA Encryption

Rivest-Shamir-Adleman," or RSA, is another prominent encryption method. It is frequently used to encrypt data transferred over the internet and depends on a public key to do so.
